<h3><em>Anointed oil...</em></h3>

<div>
	For thousands of years it's been used in 
Holy Consecrations, baptisms, and other ceremonies.
</div>
<article>
<p>But according to a controversial pastor...</p>

<mark>"We've been mixing Anointed oil 
WRONG for almost 2,000 years."</mark>

<aside>He went on to explain that we've been 
infusing the oil <span class="withoutU">without</span> its KEY ingredient...</aside>

<div>An ingredient that God himself 
hints at in the book of Exodus.</div>

<p>I'll admit, I was skeptical.</p>

<p><mark>Especially when the pastor told me that 
mixing anointed oil the CORRECT way...
"the way that God had intended" (as he put it) 
was singlehandedly responsible for 
hundreds of miraculous healings.</mark></p>

<p>Naturally, I was even more skeptical by this point.</p>

<p>But the pastor's deep belief in what he was 
saying convinced me to watch his <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/afoundarytl/index.html">video</a>, and learn more.</p>

<div>I was <i>shocked</i> when he revealed the missing ingredient, 
and frankly, very surprised by the incredibly strong evidence 
he provided to support his thesis.</div>

<p>But you be the judge for yourself.</p>

<b>SIGNOFF</>

<p>PS:  According to the pastor (and maybe he's just being paranoid but...) 
certain left-leaning departments of our government are actively trying to
suppress the secret he exposes in his <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/afoundarytl/index.html">controversial video</a> â€“ so watch it now 
while you still can.</p>
